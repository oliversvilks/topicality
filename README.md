# NLP Document Processing and Analysis API and UI

## Understanding Context in Information Processing

We live in the world of contexts. We act according to them. The context and concept of "me" in different places is different. Information we manipulate differs based on circumstances. There are different contexts of us when we are in a party or in the office, in a recruitment agency, even in one workplace in different meetings. And our work position in an organization again requires specific context of knowledge, information which in turn must be in accordance with information given or received.

Even as companies operate with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) in their processes, a personal categorization of information and processes based on this is needed. Especially if a persona could share their thoughts backed by context for others to understand.

This API serves as a bridge between these different contextual realities, allowing for:
- Context-aware document processing and analysis
- Multi-dimensional comparison of information across different contexts
- Intelligent flow-based analysis that considers contextual shifts
- Personal and organizational knowledge management with context preservation
